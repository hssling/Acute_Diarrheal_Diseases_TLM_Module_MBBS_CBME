# Acute Diarrheal Diseases: Comprehensive Teaching Module for MBBS 3rd Year Students

## Module Overview
This module provides comprehensive teaching content on acute diarrheal diseases for MBBS 3rd year students, designed for use in various teaching-learning methodologies including clinico-psychosocial case presentations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students should be able to:
1. Define acute diarrhea and classify its clinical types
2. Understand the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of acute diarrheal diseases
3. Describe clinical features, complications, and assessment of dehydration
4. Apply appropriate management strategies including rehydration therapy
5. Implement preventive measures and health education
6. Analyze clinico-psychosocial aspects in case presentations

## 1. Definition and Classification

### Definition
Diarrhea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual.

### Clinical Classification
1. **Acute Watery Diarrhea** - lasts several hours or days, includes cholera
2. **Acute Bloody Diarrhea (Dysentery)** - also called dysentery
3. **Persistent Diarrhea** - lasts 14 days or longer

---

## 2. Epidemiology

### Global Burden
- Third leading cause of death in children 1-59 months of age
- Annual deaths: ~443,832 children under 5 years
- Additional 50,851 children aged 5-9 years
- Nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrheal disease annually
- Major cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years

### Risk Factors
- Age: Children under 5 years (especially <3 years)
- Malnutrition
- Immunodeficiency (HIV)
- Poor sanitation and hygiene
- Contaminated water sources
- Inadequate breastfeeding

## 3. Etiology

### Infectious Causes
**Viral Pathogens:**
- Rotavirus (most common in children <5 years)
- Norovirus
- Adenovirus
- Astrovirus

**Bacterial Pathogens:**
- Escherichia coli (ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EHEC)
- Salmonella spp.
- Shigella spp.
- Campylobacter spp.
- Vibrio cholerae (cholera)

**Parasitic Pathogens:**
- Cryptosporidium
- Giardia
- Entamoeba histolytica

### Non-Infectious Causes
- Food intolerance (lactose, artificial sweeteners)
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Malabsorption syndromes
- Drug-induced (antibiotics, laxatives)
- Endocrine disorders (thyrotoxicosis, diabetes)

## 4. Pathophysiology

### Mechanisms of Diarrhea
1. **Osmotic Diarrhea** - Increased osmotic load in intestinal lumen
2. **Secretory Diarrhea** - Active secretion by intestinal epithelium
3. **Inflammatory/Exudative Diarrhea** - Mucosal damage and inflammation
4. **Motility Disorders** - Altered intestinal motility

### Fluid and Electrolyte Loss
- Water loss through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine, breathing
- Electrolytes lost: sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate
- Leads to dehydration and acid-base imbalance

---

## 5. Clinical Features

### Symptoms
- Increased frequency of bowel movements
- Loose or watery stools
- Abdominal pain/cramps
- Nausea and vomiting
- Fever
- Blood/mucus in stools (dysentery)

### Signs of Dehydration
**No Dehydration:**
- Normal mental status
- Normal eyes
- Drinks normally
- Moist mucous membranes

**Some Dehydration:**
- Restless/irritable
- Sunken eyes
- Drinks eagerly/thirsty
- Dry mucous membranes

**Severe Dehydration:**
- Lethargic/unconscious
- Very sunken eyes
- Unable to drink/drink poorly
- Skin pinch goes back very slowly (â‰¥2 seconds)

## 6. Diagnosis

### Clinical Assessment
- History: onset, duration, frequency, character of stools
- Physical examination: vital signs, dehydration assessment
- Anthropometric measurements

### Laboratory Investigations
- Stool examination: microscopy, culture
- Blood tests: electrolytes, renal function
- Stool electrolytes and pH
- Specific tests based on clinical suspicion

### Differential Diagnosis
- Acute gastroenteritis
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Malabsorption syndromes
- Acute appendicitis
- Intussusception
- Toxic megacolon

---

## 7. Management

### Rehydration Therapy
**Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS):**
- WHO recommended formulation
- Sodium: 75 mmol/L
- Glucose: 75 mmol/L
- Potassium: 20 mmol/L
- Citrate: 10 mmol/L

**Indications for IV Fluids:**
- Severe dehydration
- Shock
- Inability to take oral fluids
- Persistent vomiting

### Pharmacological Treatment
- Zinc supplementation (10-14 days)
- Antibiotics (selective use)
- Antimotility agents (avoid in infectious diarrhea)
- Probiotics

### Nutritional Management
- Continue feeding during diarrhea
- Breast milk for infants
- Nutrient-rich diet
- Avoid lactose temporarily if indicated

---

## 8. Prevention

### Primary Prevention
- Safe drinking water
- Improved sanitation
- Hand washing with soap
- Exclusive breastfeeding (6 months)
- Rotavirus vaccination
- Food hygiene

### Secondary Prevention
- Early recognition and treatment
- Health education
- Community-based interventions

---

## 9. Complications

### Immediate
- Dehydration
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Hypovolemic shock
- Renal failure

### Long-term
- Malnutrition
- Growth faltering
- Immunodeficiency
- Chronic diarrhea

---

## 10. Prognosis

### Factors Affecting Outcome
- Age of patient
- Nutritional status
- Timely intervention
- Underlying comorbidities
- Pathogen virulence

### Mortality Risk Factors
- Severe dehydration
- Malnutrition
- Young age (<6 months)
- Immunodeficiency
- Delayed treatment
