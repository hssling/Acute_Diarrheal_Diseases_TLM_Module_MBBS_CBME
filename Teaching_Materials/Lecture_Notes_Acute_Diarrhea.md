## Key Teaching Points

### Definition
- ≥3 loose stools per day
- Acute: <14 days
- Chronic: ≥14 days

### Classification
1. **Acute Watery Diarrhea**
   - Viral (rotavirus, norovirus)
   - Bacterial (V. cholerae, E. coli)
   - Parasitic (Giardia, Cryptosporidium)

2. **Acute Bloody Diarrhea (Dysentery)**
   - Shigella spp.
   - Campylobacter
   - EHEC
   - Entamoeba histolytica

3. **Persistent Diarrhea**
   - >14 days duration
   - Often malabsorption

### Dehydration Assessment
**No Dehydration:**
- Alert, normal eyes
- Moist mucous membranes
- Drinks normally

**Some Dehydration:**
- Restless/irritable
- Sunken eyes
- Drinks eagerly

**Severe Dehydration:**
- Lethargic/unconscious
- Very sunken eyes
- Unable to drink

### Management Principles
1. **Assess Dehydration**
2. **Rehydrate**
3. **Maintain Hydration**
4. **Feed the Child**
5. **Follow-up**

### ORS Composition
- Sodium: 75 mmol/L
- Glucose: 75 mmol/L
- Potassium: 20 mmol/L
- Citrate: 10 mmol/L
- Osmolarity: 245 mOsm/L

### Zinc Supplementation
- 10-14 day course
- Reduces duration by 25%
- Decreases stool volume by 30%

## Interactive Elements

### Case-Based Discussion
Present a case scenario and ask students:
- What type of diarrhea?
- Dehydration status?
- Management plan?

### Video Demonstration
- ORS preparation
- Dehydration assessment
- IV fluid administration

### Group Activity
Divide class into groups to discuss:
- Prevention strategies
- Community interventions
- Psychosocial aspects

## Assessment Questions

### Multiple Choice Questions
1. Which of the following is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years?
   a) Shigella
   b) Rotavirus
   c) Salmonella
   d) Giardia

2. In severe dehydration, which sign is most reliable?
   a) Sunken eyes
   b) Dry mouth
   c) Slow skin pinch
   d) Decreased urine output

### Short Answer Questions
1. Describe the WHO classification of dehydration.
2. Explain the composition and use of ORS.
3. Discuss the role of zinc in diarrhea management.

### Clinical Scenario
A 2-year-old child presents with 10 episodes of watery diarrhea and vomiting. He appears lethargic with sunken eyes. What is your diagnosis and management?
