**Key Statistics (WHO 2024):**

- **443,832** deaths annually in children <5 years
- **1.7 billion** cases of childhood diarrhea yearly
- Third leading cause of child mortality
- Major contributor to malnutrition

## Slide 7: Etiology
**Infectious Causes:**

**Viral (60%):**

## Slide 8: Pathophysiology
**Mechanisms of Diarrhea:**

1. **Osmotic** - Unabsorbed solutes
2. **Secretory** - Active ion secretion
3. **Inflammatory** - Mucosal damage
4. **Motility** - Altered transit

## Slide 9: Fluid and Electrolyte Loss
**Body Fluid Composition:**

| Component | Concentration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Sodium | 135-145 mEq/L |
| Potassium | 3.5-5.0 mEq/L |
| Chloride | 95-105 mEq/L |
| Bicarbonate | 22-26 mEq/L |

**Loss in Diarrhea:**
- Water: 200-1000 mL/kg/day
- Electrolytes: Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-

## Slide 11: Dehydration Assessment
**WHO Classification:**

| Degree | Signs | Management |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **No Dehydration** | Normal | Home care |
| **Some Dehydration** | Thirsty, sunken eyes | ORS |
| **Severe Dehydration** | Lethargic, shock | IV fluids |

## Slide 12: Management Principles
**A-B-C-D Approach:**

1. **Assess** dehydration status
2. **Rehydrate** appropriately
3. **Maintain** hydration
4. **Feed** the child
5. **Follow-up** regularly

*Step-by-step diagram*

## Slide 13: Oral Rehydration Therapy
**WHO ORS Solution:**

| Component | Amount per liter |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Sodium chloride | 2.6 g |
| Glucose | 13.5 g |
| Potassium chloride | 1.5 g |
| Trisodium citrate | 2.9 g |

**Administration:**
- 50-100 mL/kg over 4 hours
- Continue feeding
- Monitor for vomiting

## Slide 14: Zinc Supplementation
**Evidence-Based Benefits:**

- Reduces duration by 25%
- Decreases stool volume by 30%
- Prevents future episodes
- Improves nutritional recovery

**Dosage:**
- 20 mg/day for 10-14 days
- For children ≥6 months

## Slide 15: Antibiotic Use
**Selective Antibiotic Therapy:**

**Indicated for:**
- Bloody diarrhea (Shigella)
- Cholera
- Systemic infection

**Not indicated for:**
- Viral diarrhea
- Most E. coli infections
- Uncomplicated watery diarrhea

*Antibiotic decision tree*

## Slide 16: Psychosocial Impact
**Family Level:**
- Maternal anxiety and stress
- Economic burden
- Caregiver fatigue
- Stigma and social isolation

**Community Level:**

## Slide 18: Prevention Strategies
**Primary Prevention:**

1. **Safe Water** - Chlorination, filtration
2. **Sanitation** - Latrines, handwashing
3. **Breastfeeding** - Exclusive for 6 months
4. **Vaccination** - Rotavirus vaccine
5. **Food Hygiene** - Safe preparation
