## Epidemiology in India

### National Burden (2023 Data)
- **Annual Cases**: 1.5 million reported cases
- **Deaths**: 25,000-30,000 annually (mostly children <5)
- **Case Fatality Rate**: 1.5-2% (higher in rural areas)
- **Peak Season**: June-October (monsoon-related)

### State-wise Variations

| State/Region | Incidence Rate | Key Risk Factors | Major Programs |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Uttar Pradesh** | High (150/1000) | Poor sanitation, population density | UP NRHM, ICDS strengthening |
| **Bihar** | Very High (180/1000) | Flooding, malnutrition | Bihar Health Society initiatives |
| **Rajasthan** | High (140/1000) | Desert conditions, water scarcity | Rajasthan RMNCH+A |
| **Maharashtra** | Medium (90/1000) | Urban slums, migration | Maharashtra NUHM |
| **Kerala** | Low (40/1000) | High literacy, good sanitation | Kerala Health Services |
| **Delhi** | Medium (80/1000) | Urban poverty, water contamination | Delhi NUHM |

### Urban vs Rural Divide
- **Rural**: 65% of cases, higher mortality (2.1% CFR)
- **Urban**: 35% of cases, lower mortality (1.2% CFR)
- **Slums**: Highest incidence, poorest outcomes

## Cultural and Regional Considerations

### Socio-Cultural Factors

#### **Traditional Beliefs and Practices**
